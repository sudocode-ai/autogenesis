```python

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """

```

 To achieve the functionality of the `make_palindrome` function, the following approach can be adopted:

1. **Identify the Longest Palindromic Postfix of the Substring**: Starting from both ends of the provided string, expand iterations within the bounds of the input string until a palindrome is found.

2. **Constructing the Palindrome**: Once the longest palindromic suffix is located, the rest of the initial string, excluding this suffix should be reversed and appended to this suffix to form the palindromic string.

Here is an implementation of the above approach:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    """Check if a string is a palindrome."""
    return s == s[::-1]

def find_max_palindrome_suffix(s):
    """Find the longest palindromic suffix of the string from both ends."""
    # Initialize pointers for the expansion from ending points of the string
    start, end = 0, len(s) - 1
    
    # Try expanding around the center for both left (str) and right (rev_str) characters.
    success_state = False
    while start <= end:
        str_expansion = start + 1 < end and is_palindrome(s[start:end + 1])
        rev_str_expansion = start - 1 >= 0 and is_palindrome(s[end:start - 1:-1])
        
        # Move pointers based on the success of the expansions
        if str_expansion:
            end = end - 1
        else:
            start = start + 1
        
        if rev_str_expansion:
            start = start + 1
            end = end + 1
        # Success state occurs when expanding from end becomes False and
        # expanding from start becomes True simultaneously indicating palindrome found.
        # In case of symmetrical strings having a single big palindrome centered in ser,
        # setting success_state to True premature can lead to incorrect results,
        # hence we defer setting it until both directions treat strings symmetrical,
        # adjust this check if unsure about the pattern (e.g., bastion B) of the strings.
        success_state = str_expansion and not rev_str_expansion or success_state
    
    return s[start:end+1]  # Returns the longest palindrome suffix

def make_palindrome(s):
    """Create the shortest palindrome beginning with the given string."""
    # If the string is already a palindrome, return it as is.
    if is_palindrome(s):
        return s
    
    suffix = find_max_palindrome_suffix(s)
    
    # Find the prefix before the palindrome prefix
    prefix_index = s.index(suffix)
    prefix = s[:prefix_index]
    
    # Reverse the prefix and append it to the palindromic suffix
    reversed_prefix = prefix[::-1]
    
    # Concatenate to form the complete palindrome
    result = reversed_prefix + suffix
    
    return result

# Test cases
assert make_palindrome('') == ''
assert make_palindrome('cat') == 'catac'
assert make_palindrome('cata') == 'catac'
assert make_palindrome('raceacar') == 'raceacarace'  # Simply adding the second 'raceacar' (or a similar transformation method based on the original description might lead to confusion without it being specified)

```

This implementation provides a step-by-step approach to finding the shortest palindrome that begins with the given string. Note that my method for constructing the prefix might overlap the initially found palindrome's first and last characters (if central or symmetric). For completely orthogonal reasoning without relying on those, you might seek other strategies or more explicit specifications.
