**Role**: As a tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the incomplete `make_palindrome` function. These test cases should encompass Basic, Edge to ensure the code's robustness, reliability.

**Input Code Snippet**:
```python

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """

```

**Instructions**:
- The test case must be as short as possible. 
- Do not use `pytest` or `unittest` frameworks.
- Implement as plain python functions.

Please generate test cases for following code, and add "from input import make_palindrome" in top and assume make_palindrome is already defined in input.
```python

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """

```

Test case is like:
```python
def test_make_palindrome():
  assert xxxx
  assert xxxx
  ...
```

 To thoroughly test `make_palindrome`, I will create test cases covering a variety of scenarios including edge cases, the full range of input characteristics (e.g., empty strings, strings with different lengths, letter cases, special characters), and ensure teardown scenarios where the logic behavior is tested against various potential inputs. In the test cases below, I will also include explanations for expected behavior to ensure clarity in what each test confirms about the function's functionality.

Here are the test cases, including the `from input import make_palindrome` statement as requested:

```python
from input import make_palindrome

def test_make_palindrome():
    # Test with empty string
    assert make_palindrome("") == ""

    # Test simple string cases
    assert make_palindrome("cat") == "catac" # "cata" is checked for compatibility with "cat" before adding its reverse to form the final palindrome
    assert make_palindrome("contest") == "tcoentoc"
    assert make_palindrome("ai") == "iai"
    assert make_palindrome("123") == "321eedi"
    
    # Test with all lowercase and uppercase strings
    assert make_palindrome("Hello") == "HellolleH"
    assert make_palindrome("World") == "dRowodlrW"

    # Test with strings of different lengths
    assert make_palindrome("short") == "thsuorahttslhorst"
    assert make_palindrome("extraordinarily_long") == "ynatteroynegdne_lartucroserontoanelorarye"
    
    # Test with special characters
    assert make_palindrome("A!") == "A!"
    assert make_palindrome("1#!") == "1#!1#"
    assert make_palindrome("hello world!") == "!ollehdlrowolleh"

    # Test shorter string with palindrome within it
    assert make_palindrome("a") == "a"
    assert make_palindrome("aba") == "ababa"

    # Test with very long string
    import random
    import string
    long_str = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits, k=50))
    palindrome_length = len(long_str) // 4  # Arbitrary choice, aiming for a palindrome close in length
    assert make_palindrome(long_str) == long_str[:palindrome_length] + long_str[::-1]

    # Additional customized test cases and edge cases could be added here
     
    # Assuming each input string meets our function's requirement (not empty, alphanumeric characters), the edge cases such as containing symbols, or nested or partial duplicates do not require specific checks other than verifying the output format.
    
test_make_palindrome()
```

The provided test cases cover basic functionality, edge cases, and potential edge cases related to string manipulation, bringing up a solid coverage of the possible scenarios `make_palindrome` might encounter.
