  **Role**: As a tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the incomplete `{function_name}` function. These test cases should encompass Basic, Edge to ensure the code's robustness, reliability.

  **Input Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  {input_code_snippet}
  ```

  **1. Basic Test Cases**:
  - **Objective**: To verify the fundamental functionality of the `{function_name}` function under normal
  conditions.

  **2. Edge Test Cases**:
  - **Objective**: To evaluate the function's behavior under extreme or unusual conditions.

  **Instructions**:
  - Implement a comprehensive set of test cases following the guidelines above.
  - Ensure each test case is well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.
  - Pay special attention to edge cases as they often reveal hidden bugs.
  - Do not use any framework or testing library like pytest, implement as plain python with name == "__main__" entrance.
