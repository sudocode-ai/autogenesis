  **Role**: You are a software programmer.

  **Task**: As a programmer, you are required to complete the function. Use a Chain-of-Thought approach to break down the problem, create pseudocode, and then write the code in Python language. Ensure that your code is efficient, readable, and well-commented.
  
  For example:

  **Input Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  from typing import List

  def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """

    # TODO: Implement the logic to determine if any two numbers are closer than the threshold
    pass
  
  # Add your code here to complete the function (Do not include any test cases)
  ```

  **Instructions**:
  1. **Understand and Clarify**: Make sure you understand the task.
  2. **Algorithm/Method Selection**: Decide on the most efficient way.
  3. **Pseudocode Creation**: Write down the steps you will follow in pseudocode.
  4. **Code Generation**: Translate your pseudocode into executable Python code.
