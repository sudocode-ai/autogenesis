```python

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """

```

Generate 'make_palindrome'.

 Given the requirements, I'll address both corrections in the algorithm's logic and the initial requirements, aiming for an efficient solution that minimizes time and space complexity where possible. Here's a refined version of your `make_palindrome` function:

```python
def make_palindrome(s: str) -> str:
    """Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string."""
    if s == "" or s == " " or s == " ":
        return ""
    
    # Base check for a minimum length requirement
    if len(s) < 2:
        # If the string is too short, a fact-check to avoid unnecessary reverse operations
        return s + s[::-1][1:]
    
    # Optimized Approach:
    # 1. Reverse the suffix of the string.
    # 2. Find the longest position it remains a palindrome by moving backwards,
    #    and identify the starting character of this palindrome to reverse from the other end.
    n = len(s)
    rev_suf = s[::-1]  # Reverse of suffix
    l = 1
    
    # Check odd digit cases
    while l < n - 1:
        # If current two neighboring characters are reflections
        # of each other then increase compare index
        if s[l] == rev_suf[n-1-l]:
            l += 1
        else:
            # Chan the palindrome end
            break
    
    # Before reversing the needed portion
    p = s[:l]
    front_start = l
    
    # Append string in reverse at the remaining portion
    reverse_needed_portion = s[l:]
    return p + reverse_needed_portion[::-1] if reverse_needed_portion else s

# Test the corrected version
print(make_palindrome(""))  # Expected: ''
print(make_palindrome("cat"))  # Expected: 'catac'
print(make_palindrome("cata"))  # Expected: 'catac'
```

This solution provides a more streamlined and efficient approach. It includes:

- Preliminary checks for empty strings or spaces to optimize for such cases.
- A method to handle minimal length strings effectively.
- An optimized palindrome finding strategy that minimizes reversals, enhancing run-time efficiency.
- Clear and concise in-line comments explaining the strategy behind specific checks and operations for enhanced readability and maintainability.
