**Role**: As a tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the incomplete `make_palindrome` function. These test cases should encompass Basic, Edge to ensure the code's robustness, reliability.

**Input Code Snippet**:
```python

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """

```

**Instructions**:
- The test case must be as short as possible. 
- Do not use `pytest` or `unittest` frameworks.
- Implement as plain python functions.

Please generate test cases for following code, and add "from input import make_palindrome" in top and assume make_palindrome is already defined in input.
```python

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """

```

Test case is like:
```python
def test_make_palindrome():
  assert xxxx
  assert xxxx
  ...
```

 To thoroughly test the `make_palindrome` function, we need to cover a variety of cases including:

1. Empty string input.
2. Positive string inputs of various lengths.
3. Single-char strings where any single character string is its own palindrome.
4. Inputs where the entire string is a longer palindrome.
5. Cases where a palindromic addition needs to handle non-palindromic strings.
6. Edge cases and scenarios that touch on unusual or less common input patterns. 

```python
def test_make_palindrome():
    # Testing different input string scenarios
    assert make_palindrome('') == '' # Testing empty string input
    assert make_palindrome('cat') == 'catac' # A basic case
    assert make_palindrome('tac') == 'tac' # Palindrome itself as it's the shortest
    assert make_palindrome('abba') == 'abbaab' # Long palindrome
    assert make_palindrome('abcd') == 'dccba' # Simple reshuffle checking palindrome logic
    assert make_palindrome('abccba') == 'abccbac' # Checking non-palindromic attached characters case
    assert make_palindrome('race') == 'ecarace' # Middle character check
    assert make_palindrome('programming') == 'mnangrommargopgnir' # Longer string, palindrome testing edge
    assert make_palindrome('noon') == 'noonno' # Already palindrome; no extra characters needed
    assert make_palindrome('cyclist') == 'ticsyrclitcy' # Showcasing non-sequential but palindromic conversion
    assert make_palindrome('123454321') == '1234532431' # Single digit repeat palindrome
    assert make_palindrome('education') == 'noitoracedu' # Palindrome aside with check for perlmani detection

    # Edge cases and boundary conditions
    assert make_palindrome('a') == 'a' # A single-char works useful as a test case
    assert make_palindrome('ab') == 'baab' # Further tests the concatenation for non-palindromic pre-appending.

    # Test with series of characters with differing lengths but difficult pattern to identify palindrome.
    assert make_palindrome('break') == 'ekiribarb' # Encoding a 'break' into a palindrome with a mirrored section 'ebra'
    assert make_palindrome('ballet') == 'elttalabeltabel' # Showcasing extended transformation into palindrome
    assert make_palindrome('abcdef') == 'fedcbaabcdef' # Palindrome formed on the reverse of all but the main string's first character.
    
    # Additional checking the implemented logic such as palindromic section should be tentative
    assert make_palindrome('aabsnrvsd') == 'vsdrnsabarsn' # Interesting to see ASCII characters kite imagination tests palindromi skeez wy traz

    print("All test cases passed!")


# Import statement at the beginning.
from input import make_palindrome

test_make_palindrome()
```

This extensive set of test cases should cover a wide range of inputs and use cases, querying the logic and consistency of the `make_palindrome` function execution under varying conditions.
