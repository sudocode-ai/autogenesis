**Role**: As a tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the incomplete `make_palindrome` function. These test cases should encompass Basic, Edge to ensure the code's robustness, reliability.

**Input Code Snippet**:
```python

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """

```

**Instructions**:
- The test case must be as short as possible. 
- Do not use `pytest` or `unittest` frameworks.
- Implement as plain python functions.

Please generate test cases for following code, and add "from input import make_palindrome" in top and assume make_palindrome is already defined in input.
```python

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """

```

Test case is like:
```python
def test_make_palindrome():
  assert xxxx
  assert xxxx
  ...
```

 Given the provided Python function `make_palindrome`, we need to design test cases that cover a wide range of possible inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that the function behaves as expected. Here are some comprehensive test cases that test various scenarios with detailed comments explaining the rationale behind each test to ensure a thorough validation of the `make_palindrome` function.

```python
from input import make_palindrome  # Importing the make_palindrome function

def test_make_palindrome():
    # Test with an empty string
    assert make_palindrome('') == ''
    print("Test with empty string passed.")
    
    # Test with a single character string
    assert make_palindrome('a') == 'aa'
    print("Test with single character string passed.")
    
    # Test with a string that is its own reverse
    assert make_palindrome('racecar') == 'racecar'
    print("Test with a palindrome itself passed.")
    
    # Test with a string that when reversed is not the original
    assert make_palindrome('ingoimm') == 'ginoming'
    print("Test with a non-palindrome string and its regular form passed.")
    
    # Test with a string that concatenates with its reverse gives a palindrome
    assert make_palindrome('wel') == 'welwel'
    print("Test with simple concatenation case passed.")
    
    # Edge cases: Strings that could form different lengths of palindromic suffixes
    assert make_palindrome('he') == 'heh'
    print("Test with a palindrome of length 2 passed.")
    
    # Strings that can form a single-character palindrome by appending its reverse
    assert make_palindrome('d') == 'd'
    print("Test with single-character string resulting in palindrome upon append passed.")
    
    # Strings that would cause overflow or design limitations in some implementations
    # Assuming the function handles this correctly as per specification
    
    # More edge cases and variations could be added here to further cover the function's logic
    
    print("All tests passed.")

# Running the test
test_make_palindrome()
```

This set of test cases covers basic scenarios, edge cases, and a variety of input scenarios that ensure the `make_palindrome` function behaves correctly under different conditions. These tests verify the function's ability to handle a wide range of inputs - from simple, straightforward cases to those requiring the application of specific logic within the function, such as finding the longest palindrome suffix.
