**Role**: As a tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the incomplete `make_palindrome` function. These test cases should encompass Basic, Edge to ensure the code's robustness, reliability.

**Input Code Snippet**:
```python

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """

```

**Instructions**:
- The test case must be as short as possible. 
- Do not use `pytest` or `unittest` frameworks.
- Implement as plain python functions.

Please generate test cases for following code, and add "from input import make_palindrome" in top and assume make_palindrome is already defined in input.
```python

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """

```

Test case is like:
```python
def test_make_palindrome():
  assert xxxx
  assert xxxx
  ...
```

 To thoroughly test the `make_palindrome` function, we need to consider various scenarios that should cover typical, edge, and boundary cases. Here are the well-rounded test cases that cover these aspects:

```python
from input import make_palindrome

def test_make_palindrome():
    # Test with an empty string
    assert make_palindrome('') == ''

    # Test with a single character
    assert make_palindrome('a') == 'aa'

    # Test with unique characters not forming a palindrome directly
    assert make_palindrome('cbsbac') == 'cbacbac'
    
    # Test with a palindrome itself, should not be altered
    assert make_palindrome('racecar') == 'racecar'

    # Test with a single prefix palindrome
    assert make_palindrome('ll') == 'll'

    # Test with a larger input longer than its prefix and generic characters
    assert make_palindrome('programming') == 'gimmiloverg'

    # Test wherein last unique character before a palindrome is tacked onto the front
    assert make_palindrome('doorgoda') == 'gadododega'
   
    # Edge cases: extremely short and very long strings to see if performance/optimization is evident  
    assert make_palindrome('a') == 'aa' # Very small string impacting code efficiency
    assert make_palindrome(''*10**8) == '', # Long string might cause stack issues depending on Python optimizations and System's recursion/stack limits
    
    # Include strings that are not all characters or have non-correctable values that might produce unexpected results
    try:
        result = make_palindrome(None)
        assert False, "Handling of non-string input should not occur or properly raise an error."
    except Exception as e:
        assert str(e) == expected_error_message, "Should raise an exception or handle incorrect input appropriately"
    
    try:
        result = make_palindrome(123)
        assert False, "Should raise an error or specifically handle incorrect input."
    except Exception as e:
        assert str(e) == expected_error_message, "Should raise an exception or handle incorrect input appropriately"

    # Correct usage examples confirming it only modifies the preface and suffix
    original_string = 'greenfish'
    palindrome = make_palindrome(original_string)
    expected_ending = original_string[::-1]
    assert palindrome[:-len(expected_ending)] == original_string[:len(original_string)-len(expected_ending)], "Should only cover proper prefix and suffix."
    
    # Final assert to ensure overall functionality is sound
    assert all(make_palindrome(str(i)) is not None for i in range(10)), "Function should process numbers ranging from 0 to 9 although numbers usage seems unconventional."
```

This extensive set of test cases takes into account the function's parameters, correct outputs, edge cases, and even malformed or unexpected inputs, thus providing thorough coverage and validation of the `make_palindrome` function's functionality.
