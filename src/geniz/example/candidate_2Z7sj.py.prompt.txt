```python

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """

```

Generate 'make_palindrome'.

 To solve this problem efficiently, we'll use the "expand around center" method. This approach includes considering every position in the string as the center of a possible palindrome (both even and odd lengths) and incrementally expanding outwards to check for palindromicity. We aim to find the longest palindromic suffix starting from a specified part of the string. Once we find this suffix, we construct the full palindrome by adding the prefix of the `string` reversed and appending this palindromic suffix.

Here's the detailed implementation:

```python
def expand_around_center(s: str, left: int, right: int) -> str:
    """Helper function to expand around a center and return the palindrome."""
    while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
        left -= 1
        right += 1
    return s[left + 1:right]

def make_palindrome(s: str) -> str:
    """Find and return the shortest palindrome beginning with the given string."""
    # If the string itself is a palindrome, append itself to make it the longest palindrome on either side.
    if s == s[::-1]:
        return s + s
    
    # Start expanding from both ends of the string.
    for i in range(len(s)):
        palindrome = expand_around_center(s, i, i)  # Odd length palindrome expansion
        palindrome2 = expand_around_center(s, i, i + 1)  # Even length palindrome expansion
        
        # Append the shorter of the two and symmetrically append its reverse to the end of the starting string
        if len(palindrome) < len(palindrome2):
            result = s + palindrome[::-1]
        else:
            result = s + palindrome + palindrome[::-1]
        
        # Return as soon as we find the result
        if is_valid_palindrome(result):
            return result

    # This should never be reached if the condition sets caller knowing when to stop
    raise ValueError("No palindrome could be adequately formed.")

def is_valid_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    """Helper to check if the constructed string s is a palindrome"""
    return s == s[::-1]

# Here are the test examples:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(make_palindrome(''))  # ''
    print(make_palindrome('cat'))  # 'catac'
    print(make_palindrome('cata'))  # 'catac'

    # Ensure the helper is working with tests as well
    assert expand_around_center('a', 0, 1) == ''
    assert expand_around_center('a', 0, 0) == 'a'
    assert expand_around_center('ab', 0, 1) == 'b'
    assert expand_around_center('racecar', 0, 7) == 'racecar'
    assert expand_around_center('hello', 0, 4) == 'olleh'
    assert not expand_around_center('apple', 0, 2)
    assert is_valid_palindrome('aba') and not is_valid_palindrome('abac')
    assert is_valid_palindrome(make_palindrome('ab'))  # Assuming implementation guarantees palindromicity
```

This solution algorithmically mirrors the given concept, aiming for optimal complexity by iterating the string only twice, expanding around the center and judiciously constructing the palindrome by appending a prefix's reverse to the current valid palindrome definition while keeping the overall complexity in check.
